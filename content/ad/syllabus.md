# CS1660/2060 Introduction to Cloud Computing
**Fall 2025**  
**Wednesday 6:00 - 8:50 PM EST**

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

"Cloud Computing" is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of cloud computing technologies and their practical applications. This course covers a wide range of topics related to cloud computing, including virtualization, containerization, orchestration (using popular tools such as Docker Compose and Kubernetes), popular cloud services (object storage, VM, and other managed services), and cloud security models.

The course will also cover the basic design principles and architectures of Cloud Computing, including its usability and utility to deliver efficiently and flexibly metal, infrastructure, platform and software as a service. The course will also discuss public, private and hybrid cloud computing services, data centers architecture and deployment, cloud computing programming models, virtualization and virtual networking and storage, and large-scale distributed processing framework to manage, process and store big data applications running in clustered systems.

The course will be a mix of lectures and hands-on-labs. Students will be responsible for readings, completing labs, and projects.

The final grade will be based on a group project (40%), and assignments (60%). Course prerequisite is CS 1550 – Introduction to Operating Systems, or equivalent course.

After that, the only extensions will be provided in case of medical or family emergency.

If you exhaust your hours reserve, you will be penalized 10% per day.

## PROJECT AND ASSIGNMENT POLICY

The assignments and the project will be related. Most of the assignments will be designed to complete work as part of the final project. The project should be completed individually, but collaboration among students is encouraged.

- Students are expected to check the course page on canvas regularly for announcements, class schedules, lecture notes, homework assignments, reading assignments, and other related course material.
- Homework and Project assignments must be turned in prior to their specified deadline. Typically, homework is due two weeks after it is assigned unless otherwise mentioned.
- Students who face emergencies may email the primary instructor to request an extension to the homework/project submissions. Upon approval from the primary instructor, extensions will be provided for a maximum of 48 hours.
- Students are expected and strongly encouraged to actively participate in class discussions.

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

Students are expected to comply with the University of Pittsburgh's Policy on Academic Integrity.

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, assigned homework and projects in this course are to be carried out independently by each student. Students are encouraged to discuss homework and project assignments, as long as the discussions are limited to gaining understanding of the problem statement, acquiring related background or exploring general approaches to the solutions. Any other form of collaboration, including sharing homework and project solutions with other students is considered cheating.
- Cheating/plagiarism will not be tolerated. Students suspected of violating the University of Pittsburgh Policy on Academic Integrity, from the February 1974 Senate Committee on Tenure and Academic Freedom reported to the Senate Council, will be required to participate in the outlined procedural process as initiated by the instructor. A minimum sanction of a zero score for the quiz or exam will be imposed.
- Students are strongly encouraged to carefully read, understand and abide by the Academic Integrity Code for the University of Pittsburgh.

## DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION STATEMENT

Everyone is welcome, and all members of the classroom are expected to act respectfully.

## RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES
